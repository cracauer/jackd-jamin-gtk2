2005-08-17  Jan Depner  <eviltwin69@cableone.net>

	* Cleaned up the preferences dialog a bit.
	* Added warning tooltips to crossover type buttons.

	* Allow parametric notch Q handles to overlap.
	* Button 2 can now also be used to move parametric handles without
	  the possibility of missing and drawing the EQ curve.

	  select by .1 second.

2005-01-22  Steve Harris  <steve@plugin.org.uk>

	* gtkmeter.c: fixed incorrect constant in gtkmeter.c that caused the
	  meter to jump between -50 and -60 dB's.

2004-12-26  Jack O'Quin  <joq@io.com>

	* Updated ru.po from Alexandre

2004-12-15  Jack O'Quin  <joq@io.com>

	* added -j servername option to select JACK server

2004-12-06  Steve Harris  <steve@plugin.org.uk>

	* jam_ui.glade: changed packing of about dialogue so that the logo
	  fills, but doesnt expand.

2004-11-01  Jack O'Quin  <joq@io.com>

	* Use jack_client_open(), if available.  Use actual client name in
	title bar, not necessarily PACKAGE name.

2004-10-28  Steve Harris  <steve@plugin.org.uk>

	* src/process.c: added some code to change the bandwidth of the filters
	  dynamically with cutoff freq. doesnt work that well

2004-10-26  Steve Harris  <steve@plugin.org.uk>

	* src/process.c: added a #ifdef'd section on FILER_TUNING that allows
	  you to tune the filter paramters dynamically.
	* jam-ui.glade: added a window that is only created if the macro is
	  defined.

2004-10-23  Jan Depner  <eviltwin69@cableone.net>

	  Crossover type can be selected from the options->preferences menu
	  or by using the -i command line option.

2004-10-22  Steve Harris  <steve@plugin.org.uk>

	* src/process.c: Abandon using RBJ biquads and the crazy inverting
	  scheme, it was too complicated. Now using pairs of Butterworth
	  HP/LP's in a traditional crossover network. Seems to sound good.
	  The use of IIR xovers is controled by the variable iir_xover, defined
	  in process.c.

2004-10-21  Steve Harris  <steve@plugin.org.uk>

	  The code now uses IIR biquads to do the corssover. Theres a lopass
	  that splits off the lower band, mid+high is got by inverting that
	  filter then mid is extracted by lowpassing the mid+high signal,
	  and the 2nd filter is inverted to get the high band.

	  I'm not sure this is a good technique, but it seems to work.

	* src/process.c: Made a new function run_eq_iir() that uses IIR filters
	  to do the crossover.
	* src/biquad.h: Added, from sqh-plugins.
	* src/denomral-kill.h: split from process.c.

2004-10-05  Steve Harris  <steve@plugin.org.uk>

	* src/Makefile.am: Bugfix from Mario Lang to allow building on machines
	  with libxml2 headers in a non-standard location

2004-08-01  Steve Harris  <steve@plugin.org.uk>

	* jamin.1.in: Added notes saying how the OSC method can be used.

2004-07-17  Steve Harris  <steve@plugin.org.uk>

	* limiter*.c: Replaced limiter code with code to drive new limiter
	  fastLookaheadLimiter(1913). JAMin now requires swh-plugins 0.4.6+.
	* jam-ui.glade: Changed range of limiter release time.
	* process.c: removed explicit gain change code (now internal to limiter)

2004-05-30  Steve Harris  <steve@plugin.org.uk>

	* jam-ui.glade: changed minimum limiter release time to 1ms

2004-05-08  Steve Harris  <steve@plugin.org.uk>

	* controller/*: added a controller plugin. Creates thread to send OSC
	  messages to the JAMin application. Causes segfaults in jack-rack when
	  its removed, works in applyplugin, ecamegapedal and ardour.

2004-05-06  Steve Harris  <steve@plugin.org.uk>

	* state.c, compressor-ui.c: added global settings to XML file. all
	  should be read, but only the gang states are written correctly.
	  Added gang accessor funcs to compressor ui code.

2004-05-05  Steve Harris  <steve@plugin.org.uk>

	* configure.in, main.c: made OSC library optional, fixed scene change
	  code

2004-05-04  Steve Harris  <steve@plugin.org.uk>

	* main.c, jamin-scene.c: added OSC control to jamin. Additional handler
	  in main.c to accept scene change numbers on /scene. Additional
	  command line tool to send OSC messages for testing.

2004-05-02  Steve Harris  <steve@plugin.org.uk>

	* process.c (latcorbuf): Fixed limiter bypass. Added yet another
	  ringbuffer to hold the output of the compressors to allow the limiter
	  to be bypassed correctly.

2004-03-23  Jack O'Quin  <joq@io.com>

	* io.c: use first two JACK driver playback ports for default
	  output destination.  Now works with any driver, not just ALSA.

2004-02-22  Steve Harris  <steve@plugin.org.uk>

	* process.c (run_eq): linked UI controls to bypass for EQ and limiter

	* process.c (process_set_eq_bypass, process_set_limiter_bypass):
	  new functions, used to control bypass from other threads.

2004-02-17  Steve Harris  <steve@plugin.org.uk>

	* process.c (run_eq): fixed off-by-one-octave bug in frequency ->
	  bin mappings

2004-01-27  Steve Harris  <steve@plugin.org.uk>

	* process.c (process, run_eq): added functions to control
	  active/mute/byapss state of each crossover band

	* process.h: added macros for band states

2004-01-18  Steve Harris  <steve@plugin.org.uk>

	* callbacks.c (on_new1_activate): now calls s_load_session with NULL
	  to load default session file.

2002-01-13  Steve Harris  <steve@plugin.org.uk>

	* hdeq.c (hdeq_low2mid_set, hdeq_mid2high_set, comp_curve_box_motion):
	  replace stack allocated char arrays with pointers and
	  g_strdup_printf

	* scenes.c (clear_scene, unset_scene_buttons): replace stack
	  allocated char arrays with pointers and g_strdup_printf

	* configure.in: version -> 0.8.2

2004-01-12  Steve Harris  <steve@plugin.org.uk>

	* hdeq.c (hdeq_curve_motion): Changed stack alloced sprintfs to be
	  heap alloced (with g_strdup_printf)

	* configure.in: version -> 0.8.1

2004-01-12  Jack O'Quin  <joq@io.com>

	* First beta release [0.8.0].
