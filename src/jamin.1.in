.TH JAMIN "1" @VERSION@ "June 2007" "Audio"
.SH "NAME"
jamin \- JACK Audio Mastering interface

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBjamin\fR [\fI options \fR] [\fI inport1 inport2\fR [\fI outport1
outport2\fR ]]

\fBjamin-scene\fR \fI<scene-num>\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBjamin\fR command invokes JAMin, the JACK Audio Mastering
interface which is based on the JACK Audio Connection Kit,
<\fBhttp://jackit.sourceforge.net\fR>.

JAMin is designed for professional stereo audio mastering.  It
provides of a number of tools: a 1024-band hand-drawn EQ with
parametric controls, a 31-band graphic EQ, 3-band compressor, 3-band
stereo width control, lookahead limiter, boost, and other features.

For the latest JAMin information, see
<\fBhttp://jamin.sourceforge.net\fR>.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 
\fB\-f\fR \fIfilename\fR
.br 
Load session file \fIfilename\fR on startup.  If no session file is
specified, JAMin loads "~/.jamin/default.jam" if that exists, or
else uses some system-provided default settings.
.TP 
\fB\-h\fR
.br 
Print a brief usage message describing the main \fBjamin\fR options,
including some developer options not intended for normal users.
.TP 
\fB\-j\fR \fIservername\fR
.br 
Connect to JACK server \fIservername\fR.  Otherwise, use the default
server.
.TP 
\fB\-n\fR \fIclientname\fR
.br 
Set JACK \fIclientname\fR used to identify input and output ports.
Otherwise, use "jamin".
.TP 
\fB\-s\fR \fIfrequency\fR
.br 
Set the spectrum update frequency (per second).  The range is 1 to 10 
with 10 as the default.  Set to 0 to disable spectrum update.
.TP 
\fB\-c\fR \fItime\fR
.br 
Set the crossfade time in seconds.  The range is 0.0 to 2.0 with 1.0 as 
the default.  WARNING: fast crossfade times in combination with large 
jack buffer sizes may introduce zipper noise to some signals (especially 
sustained sounds in the bass range).
.TP 
\fB\-p\fR
.br 
Don't automatically connect any JACK output ports.  

Without this option, JAMin will connect to \fIoutport1\fR and
\fIoutport2\fR if they were explicitly listed on the command line.  If
not, it connects to the first two physical output ports with the
string ":playback" in their names.
.TP 
\fB\-i\fR
.br 
Use IIR type crossover instead of the default FFT type crossover.
The IIR crossover is less CPU intensive but the FFT crossover will
give better results (YMMV).
.TP 
\fB\-l\fR
.br 
Set to 0 to use Steve Harris' fast-lookahead-limiter or 1 for Sampo
Savolainen's foo-limiter.  At this time there is a problem with
the foo-limiter if you push the input too hard.
.TP 
\fB\-r\fR
.br 
Load GTK resource information from an example JAMin resource file.  If
the \fB\-r\fR option is not specified, look for a user-defined
resource file in \fB~/.jamin/jamin_ui\fR.  Otherwise, use the
system-wide GTK settings.
.TP 
\fB\-v\fR
.br 
Print verbose output.  Use \fB\-vv\fR or \fB\-vvv\fR for more detail.
.TP 
\fB\-V\fR
Print version and copyright information, then quit.

.SH FILES
.TP
.B ~/.jamin
Directory containing per-user JAMin data.  Created automatically if
it does not already exist.
.TP
.B ~/.jamin/jamin_ui
Default resource file for GTK user interface customization, used when
the \fB\-r\fR command option is not specified.  JAMin provides a
default resource file in ${prefix}/share/jamin/examples/jamin_ui.  To
customize that file, copy it to ~/.jamin/jamin_ui and make changes.
.TP
.B ~/.jamin/*.jam
Normal location for user-defined session files.  They can be stored
elsewhere, if desired.
.TP
.B ~/.jamin/default.jam
If this session file exists, it is loaded by default on startup, except
when overridden by the \fB\-f\fR option.

.SH IPC
.PP
If JAMin has been built with OSC support enabled it responds to UDP OSC
messages on port 4444.
.PP
Messages to /jamin/scene with a numerical argument cause the scene number to
change. A commaind line tool (\fBjamin-scene\fR) and LADSPA Plugin
(\fBjamin_cont\fR, ID:1912) are provided for remote scene changes.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP 
Since \fBjamin\fR is not a standalone program we generally need other
programs to provide input audio and receive the mastered output.  This
example uses \fBalsaplayer\fR with output going to the first two ALSA
playback ports:

.IP 
\fBjackd \-R \-d alsa \-p 2048 \-r 44100 &\fR
.br 
\fBalsaplayer -o jack \-s src \-d noconnect song.wav &\fR
.br 
\fBjamin src:out_1 src:out_2\fR
.br 

.PP
That was the brute force method.  It is much easier to have
\fBqjackctl\fR start the JACK server and handle its connections.
After the server is running, start \fBjackplayer\fR and \fBjamin\fR.
The "transport" option tells \fBjackplayer\fR (an \fBalsaplayer\fR
alias) to start and stop under JACK transport control.

.br 
.IP 
\fBqjackctl &\fR
.br 
\fBjackplayer \-d noconnect/transport song.wav &\fR
.br 
\fBjamin\fR
.PP 
Any JACK-aware player such as \fBrezound\fR, \fBecasound\fR or
\fBecamegapedal\fR can be used, instead.

.PP
A more advanced technique uses \fBardour\fR for both the source and
destination.  In \fBardour\fR, run all of your track outputs into a
stereo bus, connect its output ports to JAMin, then run the JAMin
outputs back into a record-enabled stereo track.  This allows mixing
and mastering at the same time.  If JAMin is already running when
\fBardour\fR reopens the session, it will automatically reconnect all
these ports.
